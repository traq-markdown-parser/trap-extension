# Source relocation

The notices below are retained from the original combined implementation.
Its delimiter engine is now in crates/core/parser, CommonMark in crates/commonmark/syntax,
generic extensions in crates/commonmark/extensions/syntax, and traP syntax in crates/trap/syntax.
Paths in the retained notices refer to that original source layout.

# Algorithm sources

The delimiter pairing in `src/engine/inline/delimiters.rs` and emphasis handling
in `src/syntax/commonmark/inlines/emphasis.rs` are adapted from
markdown-it 14.3.0 (`lib/rules_inline/balance_pairs.mjs`, `emphasis.mjs`).
The spoiler scanner follows @traptitech/markdown-it-spoiler 1.1.6.
The inline math scanner follows @traptitech/markdown-it-katex 3.6.0.
Block parsing, reference handling, and HTML recognition follow markdown-it 14.3.0.
V1 stamp recognition follows @traptitech/traq-markdown-it.
URL recognition/normalization and the frozen TLD set follow linkify-it 5 and markdown-it 14.3.0.

## Entity values

`src/syntax/commonmark/inlines/entities_table.rs` freezes the 2,125 semicolon-terminated names with values decoded
by the frontend's `entities` 7.0.1. This also preserves multi-codepoint entities.
